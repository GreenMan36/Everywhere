# IsThereAnyDeal Everywhere TS

IsThereAnyDeal Everywhere TS adds a quick price overview for each link to Steam store it can find on a page.

This is a fork of the [original extension](https://github.com/tfedor/IsThereAnyDeal-Everywhere/) but makes use of modern JavaScript practices and uses TypeScript for a more pleasant developer experience.

A small icon will appear next to each Steam store link. Moving your cursor over it will show you a tooltip that contains current best price and historical lowest price from authorized stores, as tracked by IsThereAnyDeal, as well as some quick and useful links to IsThereAnyDeal and SteamPeek.

Try it on Steam, SteamGifts, Barter.vg, Reddit, Google, Startpage, Phind or more ;)
