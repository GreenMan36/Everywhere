IsThereAnyDeal Everywhere is a browser extension that adds a quick price comparison to every Steam store link encountered on the internet.

An icon will appear adjacent to each Steam store link. Hover over it to reveal a tooltip showing the current best price, historical lowest price from verified stores as tracked by IsThereAnyDeal, along with handy links to IsThereAnyDeal and SteamPeek.

Try it on Steam, Google, YouTube, Reddit, or **everywhere**!
